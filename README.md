# Neural Network on MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build and train a simple feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras on the **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits.  
The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size **28x28 pixels** in grayscale.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Features**: 28x28 pixel grayscale images (784 features when flattened).
- **Labels (Targets)**: 10 classes (digits **0–9**).

Example distribution:
- 0 → Handwritten digit "0"
- 1 → Handwritten digit "1"
- …
- 9 → Handwritten digit "9"
